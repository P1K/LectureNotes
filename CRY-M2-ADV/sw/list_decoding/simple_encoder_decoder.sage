# C = codes.ReedMullerCode(GF(2), 1, #dim_redund)
# get base_redund*m, then use vector encoder, then broadcast, then add bits, should work




# Fast encoder from FMT (or actually, just use the existing Reed-Muller one (tho the fast part is maybe
# less visible). Unfortunately, the Boolean polynomials don't map to the multivariate polynomials over GF(2)...
# oh, but we don't really need to compute an ANF at this point anyways.
# and othw, the unencode method could be used (tho again the performance question could be raised)
# yet we still have a problem of mapping vectors to multivariate polynomials through the canonical embedding
# ah, but that's the "vector" encoding
# would need to add multipoint evaluation for Boolean polynomials using a fast MÃ¶bius transform
# also, encoding/decoding Boolean polynomials to and from binary lists. Why is this not even done??
